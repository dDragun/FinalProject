# FinalProject
For my graduation

This program is to make records of our graduation portfolio which I will do with my friend: Jeon Jiyoon.
Our goal(and of course, the goal of this portfolio) is to make a matching program with voters and candidates of congressperson or the president.

Data of voters: We will analysis comments, like or something on SNS which wrote by voters.
Data of candidates: We will use pledges of 5 candidates with 2017 Korean president election.

R language we are going to use.

I will write our news from today in this file. Also, I will add our previous news on 23 May.

News:
For now (2017-05-21), we start to learn R language.

2017-06-01.
Now I'm studying hard for my final exam. So I will continue learning R programming from 22th June.

2017-06-25.
Well, I'm busy to studying algorithm now, so I think I may start learning R programming from July.

I'm finished to learning algorithm last week. And I found that, to finish my graduation portfolio, I should use twitter API to gather user data from people. But there is a trouble! Twitter APIs are using Python language, which I never used. So now I'm studying Python language to use twitter API. I guess I will study this to end of July and start to use twitter API.

2017-07-24.
Python study finished. From now I will try to use twitter APIs and facebook APIs.

I and my partner tried to crawling data from Facebook and Twitter last month, but after long time of trying, we found that we cannot gather data which we want via security policy of SNS service company. And we also realized that matching candidate of the presidential election and electors are out of fashion. 
After discussion, we decided to write a graduation thesis individually, not graduation portfolio.

2017-09-10.
Now I have two items and doing researh to choose one item to do.

2017-09-11 ~ 09-15. 
Trying to analysis data with Python Altair, but cannot find answer.

2017-09-16. 
Data gathering finished. Change the way get line graph from Altair to Pandas.

2017-09-17.
Data arrangement completed. Next plans are: 1. Display South Korean land into divided areas with specific mark. 2. Analysis data with Python.

2017-09-18.
After trying and trying to draw line graph to display my data. I couldn't successfully get the graph I want. I tried to seperate my data into many terms. And then, I tried to use acesending number instead of real date number.

2017-09-20.
Interim Report finished.
