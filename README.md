# FinalProject
For my graduation

This program is to make records of our graduation portfolio which I will do with my friend: Jeon Jiyoon.
Our goal(and of course, the goal of this portfolio) is to make a matching program with voters and candidates of congressperson or the president.

Data of voters: We will analysis comments, like or something on SNS which wrote by voters.
Data of candidates: We will use pledges of 5 candidates with 2017 Korean president election.

R language we are going to use.

I will write our news from today in this file. Also, I will add our previous news on 23 May.

I'm finished to learning algorithm last week. And I found that, to finish my graduation portfolio, I should use twitter API to gather user data from people. But there is a trouble! Twitter APIs are using Python language, which I never used. So now I'm studying Python language to use twitter API. I guess I will study this to end of July and start to use twitter API.

2017-07-24.
Python study finished. From now I will try to use twitter APIs and facebook APIs.
